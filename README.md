# Causal Inference using Python

# Project Intro/Objective
The Python CausalImpact package employs a technique to estimate the causal impact of a planned intervention on a time series. For instance, determining the additional daily clicks generated by an advertising campaign can be challenging without a randomized experiment. This package aims to address this challenge by using a structural time-series model to estimate how the response metric might have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had not occurred.

# Installation Package
- install.packages("CausalImpact")
- library(CausalImpact)

### Technologies
- Python


### Underlying Assumptions

The CausalImpact package, specifically, assumes that the outcome time series can be elucidated by a collection of control time series that were not influenced by the intervention. Moreover, it is assumed that the connection between the treated series and control series remains consistent throughout the post-intervention period. It is crucial to comprehend and verify these assumptions in order to derive accurate and reliable conclusions for any given application.
